% EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
\section{Executive Summary}

As an external consultant supporting the implementation of Online Banking services for the national offices of the Organization of American States (OAS), my role has been centered around strategic and technical enablement to streamline project execution and visibility.

At the beginning of the engagement, the project tracking process was highly fragmented, with data managed through complex and hard-to-follow Excel sheets. The initial phase focused on data discovery, where I worked directly with national offices and alongside the Functional Lead of the initiative. Through this, I contributed both technically and strategically to uncover key bottlenecks and align with the directives expectations.

Subsequently, I led the data structuring and parameterization process, enabling a clear, actionable understanding of each office’s implementation status. This included addressing issues related to:

\begin{itemize}
  \item User onboarding
  \item Token distribution
  \item Access to respective banking platforms
\end{itemize}

A robust and dynamic data model was implemented, supporting consistent updates and efficient follow-up. Building on this, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Real-time visibility into implementation progress
  \item An intuitive view of national office statuses
  \item Tools to facilitate follow-up and reduce manual workload
\end{itemize}

Beyond the core project, I´m also in the process of developing adjacent initiatives, including:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Local Currency Funding Dashboard (2023–2025)} — tracking funding performance across time.
  \item \textbf{AP Dashboard for Issued Payments} — automating manual calculations and improving clarity.
  \item \textbf{Automated Alerts for Banking Platform Users} — enabling timely responses to maintenance issues and data irregularities.
\end{itemize}

These efforts have strengthened project governance, enhanced communication, and laid the foundation for further automation and strategic data use.

Also, unrelated to the proyect, macros have been implemented for automating excel based reports, making daily processes less repetitive and time consuming.

\section{Interactive Dashboard Overview}

The Online Banking Monitoring Dashboard was developed and implemented to provide real-time visibility into the progress of banking services deployment across all national offices.

This Power BI-based solution aggregates and structures data from multiple sources into a centralized, user-friendly interface. It enables the Functional Lead and stakeholders to make timely, informed decisions while reducing manual tracking efforts.

\subsection{General Project Status View}

    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{DASHBOARD_SCREENSHOT.png}
    \caption{General overview of activation status across national offices}
\end{figure}

This view highlights:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The number of countries with online payments fully activated (22), and those pending activation (7).
    \item A country-by-country filter for detailed tracking.
    \item A geographic heatmap that visually communicates implementation progress.
    \item A list of individual users and their access levels.
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsection{Maintenance and Token Monitoring View}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{DASHBOARD_SCREENSHOT2.png}
    \caption{Operational follow-up view by maintenance type and token distribution}
\end{figure}

This section of the dashboard includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A matrix detailing country-specific follow-up actions and responsible contacts.
    \item Status of users and banking tokens, including token type, serial number, and current usage.
    \item A token hub that centralizes security credentials across the region.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Added Value}

This dashboard represents a key pillar of the project’s success, delivering:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Streamlined access to project insights.
    \item Reduction in manual workload and email-based follow-ups.
    \item A foundation for automation, reporting, and strategic oversight.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Upcoming Additions: User Maintenance Alerts}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{DASHBOARD_SCREENSHOT3.png}
    \caption{Prototype: Maintenance Monitoring for Critical Users}
\end{figure}

This upcoming addition to the dashboard is designed to monitor user activity and maintenance requirements across banking platforms. The current mockup showcases a pie chart categorizing users into:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Active Users} — those with recent validated access.
  \item \textbf{Users Pending Maintenance} — those nearing or exceeding the update window.
  \item \textbf{Blocked Users due to Inactivity} — requiring immediate administrative intervention.
\end{itemize}

Below the visual summary, a dynamic table displays login status by country and user ID, highlighting where data is missing, outdated, or pending updates. This table enables early detection of users who may be at risk of access loss.

The final implementation will include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Automated calculations of days since last login.
  \item Email alerts triggered for pending or overdue maintenance.
  \item Support for both digital and physical token environments.
\end{itemize}

This initiative will further reduce operational risk by transforming manual tracking into a proactive and automated maintenance workflow.
